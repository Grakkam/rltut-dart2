## 0.8.0

- Part 8 - items - done!
- Continuing to use malison screens instead of event handlers. A lot of the code is a mess at the moment,
but it seems to work. Will need major refactoring down the line, though.
- You can now pick up, drop, and consume Health Potions.
- Made a bunch of changes in regards to spawning entities on the map. To clone an object in Dart the
object has to be responsible for cloning itself. All assignment is by reference, so you need to
explicitly create new instances in order to make independent copies.

## 0.7.1
