My second attempt to follow the Python tcod Roguelike Tutorial using Dart and the malison package. This time I will try to stay more true to the tutorial and only make the changes and adaptations necessary.

Sources and inspiration, from where I have borrowed heavily:

- http://www.rogueliketutorials.com/
- The Python tutorial that I am basing this project on. A great place to start if you want to get into roguelike development!

- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxI3Eu5DPwE
- "Bob Nystrom - Is There More to Game Architecture than ECS?" Fantastic talk about game programming patterns.

- Awesome roguelike, mentioned in the talk above.

- https://github.com/munificent/malison
- Two Dart packages that are immensely useful for roguelike development!
